While some entities can be configured to send their tracing data directly to an Infinite Tracing trace observer, others can have their data routed by New Relic to a trace observer. Currently, we support this feature for Mobile, Browser, and Lambda entities. In the context of Infinite Tracing, we call these entities data sources. 

## Overview

There are three ways you can update your data sources. For each of the use cases below, you can make the change by following in instructions in our GraphQL tutorial: [Update the data sources on a trace observer](/docs/apis/nerdgraph/examples/configure-infinite-tracing-graphql#updating-the-data-sources).

### ADD

If you'd like to add new data sources to the existing ones on a trace observer, use the `ADD` `DataSourceGroupUpdateType`.  No data sources will be deleted with this mutation.

### REPLACE

If you'd like to replace your existing data sources on a trace observer with a new set of values, use the `REPLACE` `DataSourceGroupUpdateType`. Any existing values not in the new set will have their status set to `INACTIVE`.

### DELETE

If you'd like to remove one or more of your existing data sources on a trace observer, use the `DELETE` `DataSourceGroupUpdateType`. Any values passed will have their status set to `INACTIVE`.
